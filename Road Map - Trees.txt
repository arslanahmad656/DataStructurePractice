Hereâ€™s a comprehensive roadmap to learning Trees, broken into stages:

ðŸŒ± Stage 0: Prerequisites Recap
Before diving in, review:

Recursion â€“ most tree problems are recursive in nature.

Basic Object-Oriented Programming â€“ especially classes and pointers/references.

ðŸŒ³ Stage 1: Tree Basics
Goal: Understand what trees are, their properties, and basic operations.

âœ… Topics:
What is a Tree?

Terminology: node, edge, root, leaf, parent, child, sibling, height, depth, degree, etc.

Types of Trees:

Binary Tree

N-ary Tree

Full, Complete, Perfect, Skewed trees

Tree vs Binary Tree vs BST

Tree Representation in Code:

Node class with left and right references

ðŸ’» Practice:
Construct a binary tree manually (using code).

Count nodes, leaves, height of tree.

Check if a tree is symmetric.

Mirror a tree.

ðŸŒ² Stage 2: Tree Traversals
Goal: Learn the different ways to visit nodes in a tree.

âœ… Topics:
Depth-First Traversal:

Preorder (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right)

Inorder (Left â†’ Root â†’ Right)

Postorder (Left â†’ Right â†’ Root)

Breadth-First Traversal (Level Order)

ðŸ’¡ Notes:
Understand recursive and iterative implementations.

Use of stack (DFS) and queue (BFS) in iterative approaches.

ðŸ’» Practice:
Print tree in different traversal orders.

Level-order traversal line by line.

Zigzag traversal.

Invert binary tree.

ðŸŒ³ Stage 3: Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
Goal: Understand BSTs and their operations.

âœ… Topics:
BST Properties

Operations:

Search

Insertion

Deletion

Validate a BST

ðŸ’» Practice:
Implement a BST with insert/search/delete.

Check if a binary tree is a valid BST.

Find the kth smallest/largest element.

Lowest common ancestor (BST).

ðŸŒ´ Stage 4: Advanced Tree Views and Traversals
Goal: Solve more complex traversal/view problems.

âœ… Topics:
Tree Views:

Top View

Bottom View

Left View

Right View

Diagonal Traversal

Boundary Traversal

ðŸ’» Practice:
Vertical Order Traversal

Print all root-to-leaf paths

Sum of all root-to-leaf numbers

ðŸŒ¿ Stage 5: Recursive Problems & Tree Properties
Goal: Use recursion to solve analytical tree problems.

âœ… Topics:
Diameter of a tree

Maximum path sum

Height balanced tree check

Subtree problems

Identical tree check

ðŸ’» Practice:
Diameter of binary tree

Path sum problems (hasPathSum, all paths with target sum)

Check if two trees are the same

Subtree of another tree

ðŸŒ´ Stage 6: Tree Construction
Goal: Learn how to build trees from different inputs.

âœ… Topics:
Construct from Traversals:

Inorder + Preorder

Inorder + Postorder

Deserialize and Serialize Tree

Build BST from preorder or sorted array

ðŸ’» Practice:
Build tree from inorder + preorder/postorder

Serialize/deserialize binary tree

Convert sorted array to BST

ðŸŒ³ Stage 7: Generic Trees (N-ary Trees)
Goal: Learn how to work with non-binary trees.

âœ… Topics:
N-ary tree node structure

N-ary traversal (DFS/BFS)

Subtree matching

ðŸ’» Practice:
Implement generic tree

Serialize/deserialize N-ary tree

Check if one N-ary tree is subtree of another

ðŸŒ² Stage 8: Special Tree Types
Goal: Understand and practice on specialized tree structures.

âœ… Topics:
AVL Tree (Self-Balancing)

Red-Black Tree (high-level idea only)

Segment Trees (for range queries)

Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)

Trie (Prefix Tree)

Heap (Min/Max Heap)

ðŸ’¡ Notes:
These are useful in competitive programming and advanced interview prep.

ðŸ’» Practice:
Implement Trie (insert, search, delete)

Implement Min/Max Heap

Segment Tree for range sum / min / max

ðŸŒ´ Stage 9: Tree + Graph Hybrids
Goal: Tackle problems where trees act like graphs.

âœ… Topics:
Tree as Undirected Graph

Finding diameter using BFS twice

Tree DP (Dynamic Programming on Trees)

ðŸ’» Practice:
Find the center(s) of a tree

Min time to burn the tree (Leaf-to-root BFS/DFS)

Distance between nodes

ðŸŒ± Stage 10: Mastery through Patterns
Goal: Solve diverse problems and recognize recurring patterns.

âœ… Common Patterns:
DFS + backtracking

DFS + memoization (DP)

Parent tracking (using hash map)

Iterative traversals

Postorder + aggregation
