✅ Pure Queue Logic
These problems are primarily focused on queues without needing knowledge of graphs or grids.

First Unique Number

Track the first non-repeating number in a stream efficiently.

Techniques: Queue + HashMap

Snake Game

Maintain body positions with a queue.

Handle collisions, growth, and food.

🟨 Grid + Queue (BFS Traversal)
These use 2D grids and BFS. Graph knowledge isn't mandatory but helps.

Rotting Oranges

Multi-source BFS to simulate rotting.

The Maze

Ball rolls until hitting a wall — modified BFS.

Walls and Gates

Fill each empty room with distance to nearest gate (multi-source BFS).

Knight’s Shortest Path

BFS with 8 possible knight moves.

🟦 Graph + Queue (Topological Sort / BFS)
These require a basic understanding of graphs. Consider visiting these after learning graphs properly.

Course Schedule (I & II)

Topological sorting using BFS (Kahn’s algorithm).

Alien Dictionary

Construct a graph and derive character order via topological sort.

Time Needed to Inform All Employees

Company as a tree/graph, find the time to inform all using BFS.

Jump Game II

Treat each index as a node; perform level-wise BFS to reach the end with min jumps.

🔁 Optional Pre-Graph Starters
These ease you into graph-style problems via BFS/DFS:

Jumping Numbers

BFS from every digit (0–9), generate jumping numbers up to n.
