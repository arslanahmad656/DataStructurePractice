‚úÖ Next Step: Trees
Learn the structure, traversal techniques, and problem-solving strategies.

What to cover:
Binary Trees

Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversal (recursive + iterative)

Level-order traversal (BFS using queue)

Binary Search Trees (BST)

Insert, Delete, Search

Validate BST

Floor/Ceiling, Closest value

Tree Problems

Height of tree, Diameter

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

Path Sum problems

Balanced binary tree check

Invert a binary tree

üìå Why next? Trees combine your understanding of recursion (from stacks) and queues (level order traversal). You‚Äôll also be ready for graphs after this.

‚è≠ After Trees: Heaps & Priority Queues
Important for scheduling, greedy, and optimization problems.

Min/Max Heap

Heapify, Heapsort

Top K problems

Median in data stream

‚è≠ Then: Hash Tables & Tries
Useful for frequency, lookup, autocomplete, etc.

Custom HashMap/Set

Anagram groupings

Trie insert/search/prefix problems

‚è≠ Then: Graphs
Once you‚Äôve done trees, you'll be ready for graphs.

BFS, DFS

Cycle detection

Topological sort

Shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)

Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
